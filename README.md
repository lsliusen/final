## Recipe
I use environment variables to store all constants used in "forget password", such as mail server, port, etc. 

Please run the commands in final/env.sh to export all environment variables, then run "env" in terminal to make sure all environment variables are shown. Run "rails server" with the same terminal session to start the server.
